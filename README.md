# GAPO - Genetic algorithm for Protein Optimization
GAPO is a _in silico_ genetic algorithm used to optimize proteins for a desired function, such as stability and affinity. The algorithm mimetizes the evolutionary process, by recombining and adding mutations to the best sequences in order to generate a new population with higher diversity and optimized for the given objetive function.

# Installing dependencies

## Getting started

## Clone the reposity
```
git clone https://github.com/izzetbiophysicist/prot_eng_GA.git
```
## Downloading pyRosetta
First of all, you must download PyRosetta.
<br />
[PyRosetta4 Download](https://graylab.jhu.edu/download/PyRosetta4/archive/release/PyRosetta4.Release.python310.ubuntu/)

Additional help for downloading and installing and PyRosetta (source:Sari Sabban youtube channel )

## Creating a conda env to run GA
```
conda create --name GA_env --file requirements.txt
```
## Installing PyRosetta in Conda ENV
### After downloading, unzip PyRosetta's and enter the setup directory to install it
```
tar -xvf PyRosetta4.Release.python310.linux.release-370.tar.bz2
cd PyRosetta4.Release.python310.linux.release-370/setup
conda activate GA_env
python setup.py install
```
<br/>

### After install GA env, install PBEE and it dependencies

https://github.com/chavesejf/pbee.

After install pbee and all dependencies, remember to put in  both pbee and GA folders and files on the same directory.
<br/>


## Running the code

genetic_algorithm.py = contains main function
<br/>
apt_functions.py = contains a collection of objective functions for the genetic algorithm
<br/>
GAprot.py imports genetic_algorithmpy and apt_functions.py, configures initial population and carries out the optimization
<br/>
### GA parameters and descriptions
  
  | Parameter | Description  | 
  | :---:   | :---: |
  |opt_direction | Selects if the objective function goes up or down
  |apt_function | Select between "apt_thread" for pbee and "apt_rosetta" for rosetta.
  |gene_values | Values that vectors can assume
  |gene_type | Selects between discrete or continuous genes
  |vector_size | Size of the vectors
  |selection_methods | Elitist or tournament selection
  |threahds | Parallel processing (not supported)
  |n_survivor | Number of survivors in each selection
  |tournament_size | Number of individuals selected in each tournament
  |lista_fixed | List of residues to maintain during evolution
  |initial_population | An initial population can be given. Otherwise, a random population is created
  |file_name | Output log file, Sequences - dG - population
  |dg_method | Select between "fold" and "bind".
  |cpus | Numbers of CPU usage to paralelize

### GA function

Follow below a usage example of the function used to optimize the CDRs from a scFv complexed to CD19 (script GAprot.py)
